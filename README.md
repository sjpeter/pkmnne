When I started this project, it was meant to be some sort of RPG or roguelike made entirely with C and ncurses. That was a big goal for a 13 year old who just started programming, and I ended up spending a lot of time on getting the grid displayed correctly. It never really proceeded beyond that, but I spent too much time on this to not keep it around for nostalgia.

## Features

* Fully procedurally generated world (random "grass" and "dirt")
* Wavy grass (they switch between `m` and `w`)
* Fully customizable character (any letter A-Z!)
* Infinite world (until the plain text save file gets too big)

In the end, this project was scoped too big for me as a high school freshman, but it was nevertheless cool to me at the time to make what I did.
